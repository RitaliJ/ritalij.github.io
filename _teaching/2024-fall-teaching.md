As a TA for *Network Algorithms*, I supported a mathematically rigorous course focused on modern algorithms for communication networks and cloud systems. The course required a strong background in probability theory, graph theory, and algorithms. My responsibilities included facilitating student understanding of advanced theoretical concepts, grading proof-based problem sets, and providing feedback on student presentations of current research papers.

### Core Responsibilities
- Held weekly office hours to assist students with probability-heavy and optimization-based problem sets
- Provided in-depth conceptual explanations on topics such as network utility maximization, stochastic scheduling, and adversarial models
- Reviewed and graded theoretical assignments requiring formal mathematical proofs
- Gave students formative feedback on research paper presentations, focusing on clarity, correctness, and engagement with the material

### Course Content

#### Foundations
- **Lecture 1**: Course Introduction â€“ scope, motivation, and applications
- **Background Lecture**: Refresher on probability, optimization, and game theory concepts critical for the course

#### Part I: Networking Through the Lens of an Optimizer
- **Network Utility Maximization (NUM)**: Formulation and decomposition
- **Congestion Control**: Layering and decomposition principles for protocol design
- **Wired vs. Wireless Optimization**: Differences in optimization strategies between network types
- **Paper Presentations**: Students led discussions on foundational and recent papers in networking optimization

#### Part II: Algorithms for Scheduling the Cloud
- **Adversarial Scheduling**: Competitive analysis and worst-case models
- **Stochastic Scheduling**: Queueing theory and probabilistic decision-making
- **Load Balancing**: Power-of-two-choices paradigm and randomized algorithms in distributed systems

### Assessment Components
- **Theoretical Homework**: Focused on mathematical modeling, proof techniques, and algorithm analysis
- **Student Presentations**: Peer teaching via in-depth presentations of contemporary research papers
