## Course Projects I TAed

As a TA for a Data Structures course, I supported students across a series of programming projects that progressively developed their skills in Java, data structures, and algorithmic thinking. Below is a summary of the key projects:

### Project 01: Ciphers
**Focus**: Introduction to Java programming  
**Description**: A project on implementing and breaking simple ciphers. Emphasized string manipulation, logic, and use of Java's standard libraries.

### Project 02: Hangman
**Focus**: Java Collections  
**Description**: A Hangman game using Java’s built-in data structures such as `Map`, `Set`, and `List`. Emphasized collection usage and modular design.

### Project 03: HTML Fixer
**Focus**: Algorithmic efficiency and data structure usage  
**Description**: Parsing and correcting malformed HTML using stacks and queues. Reinforced algorithmic patterns and real-world data structure applications.

### Project 04: Synthesizer
**Focus**: Custom data structures  
**Description**: A simplified audio synthesizer built with student-implemented linked lists and queues. Emphasized abstraction, class design, and efficient data handling.

### Project 05: Markov Model
**Focus**: Hash tables and BSTs  
**Description**: A Markov text generator involving the implementation and use of hash tables and binary search trees. Emphasized performance, hashing, and dynamic data structures.

### Project 06: BeaverMaps
**Focus**: Graphs and pathfinding  
**Description**: A campus navigation application built using graph representations and shortest-path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra’s). Combined data modeling, graph traversal, and user interface considerations.
